### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

#### Mongo installation on Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy

there was now direct installation method for lts 22.04, installation script was found on [Mongodb forum](https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/installing-mongodb-over-ubuntu-22-04/159931/89)

```bash
wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-6.0.asc |  gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb.gpg > /dev/null

echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb.gpg ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/6.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-6.0.list

sudo apt update
sudo apt install mongodb-org
```
